Week 1: Project Foundation & Backend Setup

Goal: Set up the skeleton, database, basic models, and data ingestion.

Day 1: Project Setup

Initialize Django project + Git repository.

Create virtual environment, install dependencies (Django, DRF, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, HuggingFace / OpenAI client, pandas, requests).

Set up GitHub repo and Git workflow.

Create docker-compose.yml for DB + Redis + Django dev server.

Scaffold basic Django apps: users, data_ingestion, analysis.

Day 2: Database Schema Design

Design PostgreSQL schema:

Users (with roles: admin, analyst, viewer)

Business Entities (optional)

RawFeedback (text, source, timestamp)

ProcessedFeedback (sentiment, topics, embeddings, timestamp)

Insights / Recommendations (text, score, timestamp)

Create migrations & test DB connection.

Day 3: User Authentication

Implement Django REST JWT authentication.

Role-based access control for API endpoints.

Create basic endpoints: login, signup, get profile.

Day 4: Data Ingestion Skeleton

Create models for RawFeedback.

Build API endpoint to submit new feedback manually.

Write simple data ingestion script for scraping open datasets / sample feedback (e.g., CSV of reviews, Reddit posts, Twitter via API).

Day 5: Celery Setup

Integrate Celery + Redis for background tasks.

Test a simple task (e.g., print feedback text every 10 seconds).

Connect Celery to Django and Docker-compose.

Day 6–7: Initial Feedback Pipeline

Create a Celery task to process new feedback:

Save to DB

Placeholder for AI analysis

Test end-to-end: ingest feedback → Celery task → store processed feedback.

Week 2: AI Integration

Goal: Implement NLP pipeline: sentiment analysis, topic extraction, embeddings.

Day 8: Sentiment Analysis

Integrate HuggingFace or OpenAI sentiment analysis model.

Create a Python module: input = feedback text, output = sentiment score.

Test on sample data.

Day 9: Topic Extraction

Implement keyword / topic extraction (TF-IDF, YAKE, or embedding-based clustering).

Store extracted topics in ProcessedFeedback.

Day 10: Summarization

Integrate summarization model (HuggingFace / OpenAI GPT).

Generate daily / weekly summary from processed feedback.

Day 11: Embeddings for Similarity

Generate embeddings for each feedback text.

Store embeddings in DB (PostgreSQL + pgvector or simple numpy array).

Day 12–13: Feedback Processing Pipeline

Combine sentiment, topics, embeddings, summary into one Celery task.

Ensure async processing works for multiple feedback entries.

Day 14: Testing AI Pipeline

Test with 50–100 sample feedback entries.

Verify sentiment, topics, summaries, embeddings are stored correctly.

Debug and optimize Celery + DB integration.

Week 3: Insights & Dashboard

Goal: Turn processed data into actionable insights.

Day 15–16: Generate Insights

Write Python functions to:

Detect recurring complaints or praise topics.

Identify critical negative feedback (threshold-based).

Suggest actionable recommendations (e.g., “Product X: Improve delivery speed”).

Store results in Insights table.

Day 17–18: API Endpoints

Create REST API endpoints for:

Fetch processed feedback

Fetch AI insights / recommendations

Fetch sentiment & topic analytics

Add pagination & filters (by date, product, source, sentiment).

Day 19–20: Dashboard Backend

Add endpoints for charts:

Sentiment trends over time

Top topics / complaints

Summary reports

Optional: simple CSV export endpoint.

Day 21: Dockerize AI Pipeline

Create Docker container for Celery worker + AI modules.

Update docker-compose to run Django API + DB + Redis + AI worker.

Test end-to-end with Docker.

Week 4: Frontend & Deployment

Goal: Build dashboard, finalize deployment, polish project.

Day 22–23: Frontend Dashboard

Optional React / Tailwind dashboard (or Streamlit for speed).

Show:

Sentiment trends

Topic clouds

Insights / recommendations

Alerts for critical feedback

Connect dashboard to Django REST API.

Day 24: Real-Time Alerts

Add WebSocket or polling for near real-time alerts.

Trigger email / Slack notification when critical feedback arrives.

Day 25–26: Testing & QA

Unit tests for backend endpoints.

Test Celery tasks for large batch of feedback.

Test Docker containers in production mode.

Day 27: Deployment

Deploy to cloud (Render / Railway / AWS / Heroku).

Ensure Docker containers run correctly.

Test end-to-end: feedback ingestion → AI processing → dashboard → alert.

Day 28: Polish & Documentation

Write README with project overview, architecture diagram, setup instructions.

Add screenshots of dashboard, AI outputs.

Prepare for GitHub showcase / portfolio.
